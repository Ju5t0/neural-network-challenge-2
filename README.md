# neural-network-challenge-2

IN   this assignment, I was0 tasked with creating a neural network model to help Human Resources (HR) predict employee attrition and identify which department an employee is best suited for. The goal is to develop a branched neural network that predicts both employee attrition (whether an employee is likely to leave the company) and the department that fits them best, using a dataset containing various employee attributes.
